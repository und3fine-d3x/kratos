Hooks execute logic after a flow (login, registration, settings, ...):

- _After login:_ is executed after a login was successful.
- _After registration:_ is executed when a registration was successful:
  - _Before persisting:_ runs before the identity is saved in the database.
  - _After persisting:_ runs after the identity was saved in the database.
- _After settings:_ is executed when a settings was successful:
  - _Before persisting:_ runs before the identity is saved in the database.
  - _After persisting:_ runs after the identity was saved in the database.

## Login

### After

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        password:
          - hook: revoke_active_sessions
```

#### `revoke_active_sessions`

The `revoke_active_sessions` will delete all active sessions for that user on
successful login:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        <method>:
          - hook: revoke_active_sessions
            # can not be configured
```

## Registration

Hooks running after successful user registration are defined per Self-Service
Registration Method in Ory Kratos' configuration file.

### After

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        oidc:
          - hook: session
        password:
          - hook: session
```

#### `session`

Adding the `session` hook signs the user immediately in once the account has
been created. It runs after the identity has been saved to the database.

:::info

Using this job as part of your post-registration workflow makes your system
vulnerable to
[Account Enumeration Attacks](../concepts/security.mdx#account-enumeration-attacks)
because a threat agent can distinguish between existing and non-existing
accounts by checking if `Set-Cookie` was sent as part of the registration
response.

:::

To use this hook, you must first define one or more (for secret rotation)
secrets. You can either choose to use the "default" secrets or the more specific
"cookie" secrets. The other required config is setting the hook in `after` work
flows:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
secrets:
  cookie:
    - something-super-secret # The first entry will be used to sign and verify session cookies

    # All other entries will be used to verify session cookies that were signed before "something-super-secret" became
    # the current signing secret.
    - old-session-secret
    - older-session-secret
    - ancient-session-secret

selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        <method>:
          - hook: session
            # can not be configured
```

Depending on the registration flow type the behavior changes.

### Registration Flow via Browser

When performing a registration flow with a Browser, this hook sends a
`Set-Cookie` HTTP header which contains the session cookie.

Therefore, the user is logged in immediately.

### Registration Flow via API

When performing a registration flow with an API client (e.g. mobile apo), this
hook creates a session and returns the session token and the session itself in
the response body as application/json:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "..."
    // ...
  },
  "session_token": "...",
  "identity": {
    "id": "..."
    // ...
  }
}
```

:::info

Because the HTTP reply is handled by the hook itself, no other hooks can be
executed because the HTTP reply can not be modified further (e.g. HTTP Status
Code was already sent as 200 and cannot be changed to 301). You must ensure that
the session hook is the last hook in your configuration!

:::

## Settings

Hooks running after successfully updating user settings and are defined per
Self-Service Settings Method in Ory Kratos' configuration file.

### After

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      after:
```

No hooks are available for this flow at the moment.
