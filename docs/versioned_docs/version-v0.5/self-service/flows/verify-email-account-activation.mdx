:::info

Please read the [Self-Service Flows](../../self-service) overview before
continuing with this document.

:::

ORY Kratos allows users to verify their out-of-band (email, telephone number,
...) communication channels. Verification can be initiated

- after registration or by performing a verification flow;
- manually by the user.

There are two Verification Flow types supported in ORY Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

The Verification Flow can be summarized as the following state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: User Interface renders Verification Flow Forms
  s3: Update Verification Flow with Error Context(s)
  s4: Verification challenge initiated (e.g. link via email)
  s5: Verification completed
  [*] --> s1 : User clicks "Verify Email/SMS/..."
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> s4 : User provides valid verification data
  s2 --> s3 : User provides invalid verification data
  s3 --> s2
  s4 --> s5 : Challenge response valid
  s4 --> s3 : Challenge response invalid
  s5 --> [*]
`}
/>

To enable verification flows, make the following adjustments to your ORY Kratos
configuration:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    link:
      enabled: true
  flows:
    verification:
      enabled: true
```

## Account Activation

Using this feature implements the so-called "account activation" with the
difference that ORY Kratos does not provide a feature that prevents signing into
accounts without verified addresses. The reason being that verification is
proving that the user controls the given address, but it is not an
authentication mechanism.

You may however choose to limit what an identity without verified addresses is
able to do in your application logic or API Gateways.

## Verification Methods

Currently, ORY Kratos only supports one verification method:

- The `link` method performs verification of email addresses.

### Verification `link` Method

The `link` method is dis/enabled in the ORY Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    link:
      enabled: true
      # ...
```

Enabling this method will send out verification emails on new sign ups and when
a verified email address is updated.

Before sending out a verification E-Mail, ORY Kratos will check if the email
address is already known. Depending on the result, one of the two flows will be
executed:

- Unknown email address: An email is sent to the address informing the recipient
  that someone tried to verify this email address but that it is not known by
  the system:
  <img
    alt="Verification email for unknown address"
    src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/email-verify-unknown.png')}
  />
- Known email address: An email which includes a verification link is sent to
  the address:
  <img
    alt="Verification email for known address"
    src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/email-verify-known.png')}
  />

This prevents Account Enumeration Attacks as it is not possible for a threat
agent to determine if an account exists or not based on the verification flow.

The emails are using templates that can be customised as explained in
[Customizing E-Mail Templates](../../concepts/email-sms.md#templates). The
template IDs are:

- Unknown email address: `verification_invalid`
- Known email address: `verification_valid`

You must define at least one Identity Traits field as a verification field. You
can do so by defining the following section in your Identity JSON Schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "verification": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

You can also combine this with the password method login identifier (see example
above). That way, the field `email` (or any field you define with these
properties) will serve as both the login identifier and as a verifiable email
address.

## Initialize Verification Flow to Request or Resend Verification Challenge

The first step is to initialize the Verification Flow. This sets up Anti-CSRF
tokens and more. Each verification flow has a `state` parameter which follows
the state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
	[*] --> choose_method
	choose_method --> sent_email
	sent_email --> sent_email
	note right of sent_email
	    The user may fill out the email form input again as a way to re-send the email.
	end note
	sent_email --> passed_challenge
	passed_challenge --> [*]
`}
/>

where

- `choose_method` indicates that the user has not chosen a verification method
  yet. This is useful when `link` is not the only verification method active.
- `sent_email` implies that the verification email has been sent out.
- `passed_challenge` is set when the user has clicked the verification link and
  completed the account verification.

### Verification for Browser Clients

The Verification Flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between ORY
Kratos, your Verification UI, and the end-user's browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={['verification']}
  success="Set verified flag and redirect to successful Verification Flow"
  interactions={['"Verify Email"']}
/>

To initialize the Verification Flow, point the Browser to
[the initialization endpoint](../../self-service#initialization-and-redirect-to-ui):

<CodeTabs items={initBrowserFlow} />

The server responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the Verification UI, appending
the `?flow=<flow-id>` query parameter (see the curl example) to the URL
configured here:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    verification:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/verification?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/verification
```

### Verification for API Clients

<ApiWarning />

The Verification Flow for API clients does not use HTTP Redirects and can be
summarized as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow
  flows={['verification']}
  success="Set verified flag to true"
  interactions={['"Verify Email"']}
/>

To initialize the API flow, the client calls the API-flow initialization
endpoint
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#initialize-verification-flow-for-api-clients))
which returns a JSON response:

<CodeTabs items={initApiFlow} />

## Verification Flow Payloads

Fetching the Verification Flow
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#get-verification-flow)) is usually
only required for browser clients but also works for Verification Flows
initialized by API clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

<CodeTabs items={getFlow} />

### Send Verification Link to Email

:::note

The `link` verification mode will always open a link in the browser, even if it
was initiated by an API client. This is because the user clicks the link in
his/her email client, which opens the browser.

:::

When the `link` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload in
the Verification Flow:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
    'http://127.0.0.1:4434/self-service/verification/flows?id=4fd52be5-5f80-4493-ab5c-90cb9bd331d2' | jq -r '.methods.link.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/verification/methods/link?flow=4fd52be5-5f80-4493-ab5c-90cb9bd331d2",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "l6jPm/3mDxYAODgv4SDitfCyfWD3+PH+loc5//E/UDFiJA9P3h6KCNKDyn/OpIrlEjv6Tf4Zaurp7KN/dD07Yg=="
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification Flow Form Rendering

The Verification User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application
(server, native app, single page app) that should render a verification form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Verification Flow JSON response to render the verification form
UI, which could looks as follows depending on your programming language and web
framework:

<RenderFlow flow="verification" />

## Verification Form Validation

The form payloads are then submitted to ORY Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 302 Found redirect pointing to the Verification UI for Browser
  Clients.
- An `application/json` response for API Clients.

### Verification Link via Email

To send the verification email, the end-user fills out the form. There might be
validation errors such as a malformed email:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkWithErrors} />

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 302 Found redirect
to the Verification Flow UI, containing the Verification Flow ID which includes
the error payloads.

For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the
Verification Flow in the response payload as JSON.

#### Successful Submission

On successful submission, an email will be sent to the provided address:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkSuccess} />

## Unsuccessful Verification

If the verification challenge (e.g. the link in the verification email) is
invalid or expired, the user will be HTTP 302 redirected to the Verification UI.

:::note

When an invalid or expired challenge is used, ORY Kratos initializes a new
Account Verification flow automatically. This flow will always be a
Browser-based flow because the challenge is completed by clicking a link!

:::

The new Verification Flow includes an error message such as the following:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkInvalidChallenge} />

Please keep in mind that this part of the flow always involves a Browser!

## Successful Verification

If the verification challenge is completed (e.g. the sent verification link was
clicked), the end-user's Browser is redirected to the Verification UI with a
Verification Flow that has now the `state` of `passed_challenge`:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkChallengeDone} />

You may also
[configure a redirect URL](../../concepts/browser-redirect-flow-completion.mdx)
instead which would send the end-user to that configured URL.
